## Introduction

Welcome to the `python_pygame` repository! This repo is a collection of some projects created using the Pygame library. The primary goals of these projects are to enjoy my free time creating simple games while practicing object-oriented programming (OOP), software design, and various programming principles.

## Projects

### [Space Invaders]((https://github.com/Omarkhaled711/python_pygame/tree/master/space_invader))

Space Invaders is a classic arcade game where the player controls a spacecraft to defend against waves of enemies. This project demonstrates the use of Pygame to handle graphics, user input, and game logic.
